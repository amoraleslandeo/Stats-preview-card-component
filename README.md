## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that this property contains a specific area, allowing it to be given attributes only in that space.
```css
.banner {
     position: relative;
```

I learned how to place a color layer on top of a contained image. With this sequence of attributes.
```css
.mask_image {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    background: #AB5CDB;
```

I learned to blend a color layer with an image with these attributes. 
```css
img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    opacity: .7511;
```

I learned that this property allows you to crop content that is within a specific area of â€‹â€‹an image with a background.
```css
    overflow: hidden;
```

In this project I learned to use the SASS language for CSS. This allows me to structure the tags and their properties in the same way as HTML. The advantages of this language are the similarity with HTML and also the lightness of the final file, which allows the code uploaded to the browser to be processed much faster.
